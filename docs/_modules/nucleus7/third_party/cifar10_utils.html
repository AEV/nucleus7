<span class="c1">#   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   &quot;Contribution&quot; shall mean any work of authorship, including</span>

<span class="c1"># 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="c1">#   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>
<span class="c1">#   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable</span>

<span class="c1"># 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="c1">#   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,</span>

<span class="c1">#   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)</span>
<span class="c1">#   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You</span>
<span class="c1">#   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a</span>
<span class="c1">#   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work</span>
<span class="c1">#   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct</span>
<span class="c1">#   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses</span>
<span class="c1">#   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate</span>
<span class="c1">#   as of the date such litigation is filed.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the</span>
<span class="c1">#   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without</span>
<span class="c1">#   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You</span>
<span class="c1">#   meet the following conditions:</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or</span>
<span class="c1">#       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices</span>
<span class="c1">#       stating that You changed the files; and</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works</span>
<span class="c1">#       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and</span>
<span class="c1">#       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,</span>
<span class="c1">#       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of</span>
<span class="c1">#       the Derivative Works; and</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   (d) If the Work includes a &quot;NOTICE&quot; text file as part of its</span>
<span class="c1">#       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must</span>
<span class="c1">#       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained</span>
<span class="c1">#       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not</span>
<span class="c1">#       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one</span>
<span class="c1">#       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed</span>
<span class="c1">#       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or</span>
<span class="c1">#       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,</span>
<span class="c1">#       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and</span>
<span class="c1">#       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents</span>
<span class="c1">#       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and</span>
<span class="c1">#       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution</span>
<span class="c1">#       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside</span>
<span class="c1">#       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</span>
<span class="c1">#       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</span>
<span class="c1">#       as modifying the License.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1">#   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</span>
<span class="c1">#   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions</span>
<span class="c1">#   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or</span>
<span class="c1">#   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,</span>
<span class="c1">#   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with</span>
<span class="c1">#   the conditions stated in this License.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</span>
<span class="c1">#   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work</span>
<span class="c1">#   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of</span>
<span class="c1">#   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.</span>
<span class="c1">#   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify</span>
<span class="c1">#   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed</span>
<span class="c1">#   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade</span>
<span class="c1">#   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,</span>
<span class="c1">#   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the</span>
<span class="c1">#   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</span>
<span class="c1">#   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</span>
<span class="c1">#   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS,</span>
<span class="c1">#   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or</span>
<span class="c1">#   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions</span>
<span class="c1">#   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A</span>
<span class="c1">#   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the</span>
<span class="c1">#   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any</span>
<span class="c1">#   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,</span>
<span class="c1">#   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,</span>
<span class="c1">#   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly</span>
<span class="c1">#   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be</span>
<span class="c1">#   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,</span>
<span class="c1">#   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a</span>
<span class="c1">#   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the</span>
<span class="c1">#   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,</span>
<span class="c1">#   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all</span>
<span class="c1">#   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor</span>
<span class="c1">#   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing</span>
<span class="c1">#   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,</span>
<span class="c1">#   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,</span>
<span class="c1">#   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this</span>
<span class="c1">#   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only</span>
<span class="c1">#   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf</span>
<span class="c1">#   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,</span>
<span class="c1">#   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability</span>
<span class="c1">#   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason</span>
<span class="c1">#   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
<span class="c1"># APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.</span>
<span class="c1">#</span>
